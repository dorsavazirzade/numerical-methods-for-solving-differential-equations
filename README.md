# Numerical Methods for Solving Differential Equations

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using numerical methods. The included codes are designed to demonstrate and compare different approaches for solving ODEs.

## Files
### 1. ODE_ABM_PreCor.m

This script implements the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton (ABM) predictor-corrector method for solving ODEs. The ABM method is a multistep technique that combines explicit (predictor) and implicit (corrector) steps to improve accuracy and stability.

#### Features:
*  Predictor and corrector steps are implemented iteratively.
*  Suitable for solving initial value problems (IVPs).
*  Example usage is provided within the script.
*  
### 2. odeEulerPreCor.m
   
This script uses the Euler method as a base for implementing a simple predictor-corrector scheme. It is an introductory example for enhancing the Euler method by including a correction step.

#### Features:
*  Demonstrates the limitations of the Euler method and improvements with correction.
*  Easy to adapt for different ODEs.


### 3. test.m
   
This script is used for testing and validating the numerical methods implemented in the other scripts. It includes:

*  Definitions of ODEs to be solved.
*  Calls to the ODE_ABM_PreCor and odeEulerPreCor functions for comparison.
*  Visualization of results, including error analysis and solution plots.
